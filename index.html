              <p class="text-center">They say that the greatest ideas come from the simplest questions, hitherto unanswered. In 2012, someone threw such a simple question, "Why do we never celebrate MAD's birthday?" It was then that Mafia took charge and MAD Week was born. The idea was to celebrate our birthday with everyone and spread some happiness. Why? Because Happiness is Contagious, of course! A tide of hugs, hi5s, smiles, laughter and a whole lot of happiness has swept the nation since then. With every year as MAD grows, our circle of happiness grows a little bit wider.</p>

              <p class="text-center">Soon after the commencement of the 2013 session, Anish Bhattacharya, Mafia from Vellore struck upon what sounded like a seemingly insane idea. He wanted to organise a campaign, with people walking...backwards. The idea, he said, was to push back illiteracy. After it was floored in Vellore, a few quick Whatsapp conversations followed and MafIIa decided to unitedly Push Back Illiteracy on September 8th, World Literacy Day. As the first rays of the sun touched the skies, Vizag kickstarted what went on to become a movement. All 23 cities since then have taken up the pledge to #MoveForward</p>

              <p class="text-center">We realised that we were growing. With the blink of an eyelid, MAD had spread to different corners of the city. The need of the moment was to stay united. In this crusade that we had undertaken to provide our children with equal outcomes, we had to hold on to each other, hand in hand. Unitedly, as One Big MAD. It dawned on us then-everything we do, what we have done and what will go on to do, depends on us. That it starts with us. Without the people, we are nothing. MAD will always be what it is for the people. Thus was born the recruitment campaign was 2014 #ItStartsWithUs. And indeed, it does.</p>

I believe campaigns are the biggest form of collective expression and to me, it opened up a platform to work with like minded people to build such campaigns and I cherished every moment of it. It was like getting into a room with 20 other mafiosis and a mic and screaming out to the rest of the world, the voice of the brand. I guess it was just that simple. <br/> Cheers to another year of making campaigns the world can't refuse. :)</p>

But as time passed, we became so close to each other that when you suddenly turn back, you see that Mafia has become your extended family. Always there to help each other, no matter what. Not letting each other down and always being there for each other. And ofcourse, all the amazing work and fun!</br>Mafia is love. Mafia is family. Mafia is brotherhood. :) "</p>

              <h4>Mafia.</br>
One word. Several people. A million memories. A gazillion smiles.</br>
Barely even begins to sum up what Mafia really is. What started off as a random whatsapp group full of people who were crazy enough to do things the world scoffed at and came out winning on the other side, soon became something that brought a smile to everyone's face.</br>
For me my Mafia journey began in 2012 LC when I attended the first couple of sessions in PR and realized that all these people from different walks of life were as loony and weird as I was. Someone, I forget who, once said that this team is a bunch of social misfits. And in our weirdness we found love. We found acceptance. And boy did we kick ass.</br>
Mafia changed the way I saw people, situations, challenges and helped me face my inner demons. Mafia has made me the way I am today and I wear that as a badge of honor. Mafia is my support system. Mafia is that silver lining to the cloud that ever so often casts a shadow. </br></br></h3>
